<p> SameLane Passenger Terms of Service
Last Updated: 
Welcome to SameLane! Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully because they govern your (“you” or “Passenger”) use of Corral Labs, Inc.’s (“SameLane,” “we” or “us”) mobile device application (“App”) and website located at www.takeSameLane.com (the “Site”) and our platform for obtaining local transportation services (“Rides”) accessible via our App and Site. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, the App and our platform and services are collectively called the “Services.”
Agreement to Terms
By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.
Changes to Terms or Services
We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or App or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site or App, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can’t use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, SameLane DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, AND SameLane IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER. IT IS UP TO THE DRIVER TO OFFER TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, WHICH MAY BE REQUESTED BY A PASSENGER THORUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES. ANY DECISION BY A PASSENGER TO ACCEPT TRANSPORTATION ONCE SUCH PASSENGER IS MATCHED THROUGH THE SERVICES WITH A DRIVER IS A DECISION MADE IN SUCH PASSENGER’S SOLE DISCRETION. SameLane OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO CONNECT DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS WITH EACH OTHER, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OR ACT IN ANY MANNER AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED TO ANY PASSENGER BY ANY DRIVER USING THE SERVICES.
Who May Use the Services
Eligibility
You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with SameLane and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.
Registration and Your Information
If you want to access and use the Services, you’ll have to create an account (“Account”). You can do this via the App through your account with Facebook (your “SNS Account”). We’ll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.
It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.
The Services
Through the Services, we provide a platform that allows you to schedule Rides provided by individuals registered with SameLane to provide Rides (each, a “Driver”), including the ability to:
    • Post a profile;
    • Schedule Rides;
    • Communicate with, contract with, pay and rate (and get rated by) other Passengers and Drivers and provide feedback to Drivers.
You may reserve a Ride by providing the necessary descriptive information for the desired Ride through the App, including (i) the pick-up and drop-off locations, and (ii) the number of passengers in your party (collectively, the “Ride Description”). You will also be presented with a quote for the applicable Ride Fee (as defined below) before you confirm your reservation. Through the Services, upon submitting a Ride Description and requesting such Ride to be scheduled, a Driver will be contacted to provide your requested Ride. You will have the ability to cancel such Ride for a reasonable period of time after you’ve booked your reservation (the “Cancellation Period”). SameLane reserves the right to charge you with a cancellation fee if you cancel your Ride reservation after the Cancellation Period expires. You acknowledge and agree that other Passengers may also be in the Driver’s vehicle obtaining Rides, or may be picked up and dropped off by your Driver, while your Ride is being provided. If there are other Passengers in your Driver’s vehicle prior to your pick-up time who will be present during your Ride, you will be provided certain information about such Passenger(s) before you confirm your Ride reservation.
The provision of Rides involves a direct contractual relationship between you and a Driver, and Passengers and Drivers agree that they will contract directly with one another for the provision of Rides. You acknowledge and agree that this contractual relationship is formed when a Driver agrees to provide your Ride through the Services. In such an instance, the Passenger agrees to pay for (subject to Passenger’s right to cancel such Ride during the Cancellation Period), and the Driver agrees to perform, the Ride in accordance with the following terms and agreements: (1) these Terms and the Driver Terms of Service available at takeSameLane.com/driverterms; (2) the Ride Description, and (3) the Ride Fee (as further described in “Payment Terms” below) (collectively, a “Ride Contract”). You also agree with, and that each of your Ride Contracts will include, the following terms:
    • Driver shall perform Rides for Passengers in a timely, professional and workman like manner, in accordance with the applicable Ride Description.
    • Upon the completion of the Ride, Passenger is responsible for and shall pay the applicable Ride Fee. The SameLane Services Fee will be deducted from the Ride Fee and the balance will be remitted to Driver as Driver’s payment for provision of the Ride. Driver will not receive any payment until Passenger pays the Ride Fee and Passenger remains responsible for all applicable Ride Fees.
    • Passenger will not interfere with Driver’s performance of other Rides for other Passengers.
    • Driver and Passenger acknowledge that SameLane does not, in any way, direct or control Driver’s provision of Rides to Passengers.
    • Passenger and Driver agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend SameLane from any and all claims arising out of or related to their Ride Contract, including but not limited to claims arising out of the provision of Rides by Driver to Passenger.
SameLane offers a technology platform to provide the Services and is not involved in the provision of Rides. SameLane’s sole responsibility with respect to Ride Contracts is limited to (i) facilitating the availability of the Services, and (ii) serving as the limited authorized agent of the Drivers for the purpose of accepting payments from Passengers on behalf of the Drivers and transmitting such payments to the Drivers as described below. As stated more fully below, SameLane is not the employer of the Drivers.
SameLane provides excess liability insurance up to $1,000,000 per occurrence covering Passengers and Drivers during Rides. However, Drivers are otherwise responsible for insurance for the vehicles they use to provide Rides. As with any automobile insurance policy, additional insurance terms, limitations and exclusions apply.
Payment Terms
You agree to pay, and authorize SameLane’s third party payment processor to charge via the credit card or third party payment processing account on file in your Account (your “Payment Method”) for all applicable fees and taxes that may accrue in relation to your use of the Services and Ride Contracts.
Ride Fees
You will be charged a fee by your Driver for each Ride completed by your Driver (“Ride Fee”). Ride Fees vary based on the particular Ride in question and the number of individuals in Passenger’s party. When scheduling a Ride through the App, you will be provided a quote of the applicable Ride Fee before you confirm your reservation.
In consideration for their access to the Services, Drivers authorize SameLane to retain a percentage of Ride Fees (“SameLane Services Fee”). When a Ride is completed, the Ride Fee for such Ride will be automatically charged to your Payment Method and processed by SameLane’s third party payment processor. However, if your SameLane Account is credited with funds to be used for Ride Fees (“Account Credit”), SameLane will deduct the applicable Ride Fee from your Account Credit and pass on the Ride Fee directly to the Driver on your behalf, after applicable deduction of the SameLane Services Fee. If your Account Credit is not sufficient to cover the Ride Fee, SameLane will first deduct your available Account Credit before the remaining amount is charged to your Payment Method. With the exception of the SameLane Services Fee, the Account Credit or funds collected by SameLane’s third party payment processor do not belong to SameLane. Immediately following SameLane’s third party payment processor’s receipt of the Ride Fee, SameLane’s third party payment processor will remit to the Driver the applicable Ride Fee less the SameLane Services Fee, and funds will only be passed on to Drivers after payment has been collected from you. You acknowledge and agree that in all cases SameLane acts as the Driver’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Driver.
You acknowledge and agree that SameLane may, and authorize SameLane to, charge your Payment Method up to $250 on a per-Ride basis for any damages incurred by your Driver that were caused by you during a Ride, as determined in SameLane’s sole discretion.
You are responsible for providing complete and accurate Payment Method and contact information to us. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if a Ride Fee is 30 days past due. All fees and payments are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms. All amounts referred to in these Terms, including those set forth through the Services, are stated in U.S. dollars and do not include any taxes. You will be responsible for the payment of any taxes applicable to any payments made hereunder, except taxes based on SameLane’s income or the income of the Drivers. SameLane has no obligation to provide refunds or credits relating to any Rides, but may do so in SameLane’s sole discretion.

We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”). You can submit Feedback by emailing us as support@takeSameLane.com. You grant to us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license under any and all intellectual property rights that you own or control to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.

If you accessed or downloaded the App from any app store or distribution platform (like the Apple Store or Google Play) (each, an “App Provider”), then you acknowledge and agree that:
    • These Terms are concluded between you and SameLane, and not with App Provider, and that, as between SameLane and the App Provider, SameLane is solely responsible for the App.
    • App Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
    • In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify App Provider and App Provider will refund the purchase price for the App to you (if applicable) and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, App Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App. Any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of an App to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of SameLane.
    • App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App or your possession and use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

    • App Provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, App Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the App against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
    • You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the App.
    • You agree to comply with all U.S. and foreign export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the App nor any technical data related thereto nor any direct product thereof is exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations. By using the App you represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Links to Third Party Websites or Resources

Nature of Driver Relationship
Drivers are not employees of SameLane and nothing in these Terms will be construed as establishing an employment or agency relationship between Drivers and SameLane. Drivers have no authority to bind SameLane by contract or otherwise. Drivers will determine, in their sole discretion, the manner and means by which Rides are provided and performed, subject to the requirement that they will at all times comply with applicable law, applicable Driver Terms and the terms of the applicable Ride Contracts.
Warranty Disclaimers
THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any Content.
SameLane CONDUCTS BACKGROUND CHECKS INCLUDING CRIMINAL AND MOTOR VEHICLE BACKGROUND CHECKS ALONG WITH A REVIEW OF OTHER RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON ITS DRIVERS. FURTHER, ONLY DRIVERS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE SameLane’S SCREENING PROCESS, AS DETERMINED IN SameLane’S DISCRETION, WILL BE ALLOWED TO USE THE SERVICES TO PROVIDE RIDES. SameLane ENDEAVORS TO ENSURE POSITIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DRIVERS AND FELLOW PASSENGERS, AND WORKS HARD TO ENSURE AN OPTIMAL, COMFORTABLE AND SAFE EXPERIENCE; HOWEVER, OUR DRIVERS AND OTHER PASSENGERS ARE HUMAN BEINGS, AND NO ONE IS PERFECT. SameLane DOES NOT CONTROL, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY, RELIABILITY, OR ACCURACY OF, THE DRIVERS’ PROVISION OR PERFORMANCE OF RIDES OR THE CONDITION OF THE VEHICLES IN WHICH RIDES ARE PERFORMED, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT OTHER PASSENGERS WHO MAY BE PRESENT DURING YOUR RIDES. THE PROVISION AND QUALITY OF RIDES REQUESTED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS ENTIRELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APPLICABLE DRIVER. SameLane MAKES NO WARRANTY, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE ACCEPTS LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH AND/OR ARISING FROM, DRIVER’S PROVISION OF RIDES, THE CONDITION OF THE VEHICLES IN WHICH RIDES ARE PERFORMED, ANY ACTS, ACTION, BEHAVIOR, CONDUCT, AND/OR NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE DRIVER OR OTHER PASSENGERS PARTICIPATING IN YOUR RIDES, OR ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY DURING OR AFTER A RIDE.
Assumption of Risk and Indemnity
YOU KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL RISK WHEN USING THE SERVICES. YOU, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF, YOUR PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES AND YOUR HEIRS, HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO RELEASE, WAIVE, DISCHARGE, HOLD HARMLESS, DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY SameLane AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, DISPUTES, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING FEES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT OR YOUR USER CONTENT (II) RIDE CONTRACTS OR YOUR RECEIPT OF RIDES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR BODILY INJURY, WRONGFUL DEATH, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, OR OTHER DAMAGES OR HARM, WHETHER TO YOU OR TO THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE PROVISION OF RIDES OR PARTICIPANTS THEREIN, OR (III) VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLAIMS FOR BODILY INJURY, WRONGFUL DEATH, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF SERVICES OR OTHER DAMAGES OR HARM, WHETHER TO YOU OR TO THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.
Limitation of Liability
NEITHER SameLane NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SameLane HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
SameLane WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY THAT ARISES OUT OF OR RELATES TO DRIVER’S PROVISION OF RIDES OR ANY RIDE CONTRACT OR ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM THAT ARISES OUT OF OR RELATES TO DRIVER’S OR OTHER PASSENGERS’ ACTIONS OR INACTIONS, DRIVER’S PROVISION OF RIDES OR ANY RIDE CONTRACT.
IN NO EVENT WILL SameLane’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT EXCEED $1000.
THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN SameLane AND YOU.
Dispute Resolution
Between You and Another User
Because SameLane is not involved in the provision of Rides, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more other Passengers or Drivers, as applicable (each, an “Other Party”), you agree to address such dispute directly with the Other Party in question. You release SameLane (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) (collectively “Releasees”) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute. If such a dispute arises, SameLane may, in its sole discretion, facilitate communication between you and the Other Party in connection with such dispute. If such a dispute is unable to be resolved between you and the Other Party, SameLane may, in its sole discretion, and where feasible, intervene in such dispute and take any actions we deem appropriate.
Governing Law
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Agreement to Arbitrate
You and SameLane agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and SameLane arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and SameLane are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class Passenger in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and SameLane otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
Arbitration Rules
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
Arbitration Process
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Arbitration Location and Procedure
Unless you and SameLane otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and SameLane submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Arbitrator’s Decision
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. SameLane will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
Fees
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, SameLane will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
Changes
Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if SameLane changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@takeSameLane.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of SameLane’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and SameLane in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
General Terms
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between SameLane and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between SameLane and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without SameLane’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. SameLane may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications provided by SameLane under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: by SameLane (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
SameLane’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of SameLane. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
